(** Our challenge here is that we know we will want to fold a class, i.e.
  [Decl_provider.get_class]. And we want to concurrently "prefetch" all the
  shallow decls (classes, typedefs, ...) that will be needed to fold that class.
  But we can't know the full answer yet! All we can do is give an incremental
  answer, for instance "you wanted to fold class Foo, and I know that we'll therefore
  need to fold its parent Bar, but Bar is currently absent from cache." What this
  function does is return a list of all things it so far discovers that are absent
  from cache but will be needed. The caller will have to direct-decl-parse them,
  add them into the cache, and then call this function again to learn if anything
  further is missing.

  [Decl_provider.get_class "Foo"] needs to fold all parents of Foo. But it also calls
  [Decl_enforceability] on each return type of each method in Foo itself.
  This needs to fetch shallow decls mentioned in those return types. Or, if they're
  typedefs, it needs to resolve the typedef by fetching its shallow decl and then
  fetching whatever the typedef expands to.

  The parameters of this function: [to_fold] are the type names we know we wish to resolve
  any typedef aliases and then fold them and all their ancestors; [to_ty] are the type
  names which we know we wish to resolve any typedef aliases but have no need to fold
  ancestors.

(** This function incrementally fetches into [local_memory] caches at least all
  the direct-decl-parser results needed for [to_decl] and which aren't
  already in [local_memory] caches:
  * For [to_decl.funs,consts,modules] it places these named decls into [local_memory.decl_cache]
  * For [to_decl.types_to_shallow] if the name resolves to a classlike then it places
    that decl into [local_memory.shallow_decl_cache]; if it resolves to a typedef
    then it goes into [local_memory.decl_cache].
  * For [to_decl.types_to_fold] if the type name resolves to classlike
    then it anticipates what shallow decls and typedefs that [declare_folded_class]
    will need to fold it, and places them into [local_memory.shallow_decl_cache,decl_cache].
    If the type name resolves to a typedef, then it fetches that typedef decl
    into [local_memory.decl_cache], and recursively does "types_to_fold" for all
    named types in the expansion of the typedef.
  * Just like normal decl-fetching works, if ever we need part of the output of
    the direct-decl-parser for a file, then we take the opportunity to place
    all of the file's decls into [local_memory] caches.
  * This function is robust against missing decls

  What does "incrementally fetches" mean? Say we have [to_fold="D"]. We might
  fetch the shallow-decl for D, then learn that it extends C, then fetch
  the shallow-decl for C, then learn that it extends A and B and so fetch
  those shallow-decls too. In folding, we only learn what further things to
  fetch after we've already started. This function also is able to see which
  decls are already present in cache, and avoids fetching them again.

  This function aims to be fast. The slow part of fetching is direct-decl-parsing.
  This function uses multiple concurrent threads under the hood. For instance
  given [to_fold="C"], if we fetched C and discovered that C extends both A and B,
  then we can use two concurrent threads to decl-parse A and B.

  What does "anticipate what will be needed to fold a class" mean? Say we have
  [to_fold="D"]. The [declare_folded_class] algorithm will first transitively
  fold all of D's ancestors, and then (for pessimisation) it will shallow-fetch
  everything mentioned in return types.

  Why "at least all the decls"? The pessimisation step walks the return type
  of functions in a subtle way. This function instead just blindly grabs everything
  mentioned in the return type.

  Why "robust against missing decls"? This might arise in a few ways. First,
  if the user writes "class C extends B {}" but B isn't yet defined, then
  we simply won't fetch B. If the naming table thought that B was defined in b.php,
  but a disk change has happened (and the naming table hasn't yet been updated)
  then we'll parse the file if it exists, and either we'll find B or not.

  Sorry, our decl-caches are ugly. That's because [decl_cache] contains
  funs, typedefs, consts, modules (primitive things) and also folded-classes,
  while [shallow_decl_cache] contains shallow-classes (primitive). *)
