        This will happen when there is a typed local declared along some control
        paths but not others. In this case, using the variable is still an
        error, but any assigning to it should still follow the bound. *)

      (** The bound on the variable if it is a typed local. *)
  pos: Pos.t;  (** The position at which the variable got its type. *)
  eid: Expression_id.t;
      (** Along with a type, each local variable has a expression id associated with
          it. This is used when generating expression dependent types for the 'this'
          type. The idea is that if two local variables have the same expression_id
          then they refer to the same late bound type, and thus have compatible
          'this' types. *)

      (** If the variable is bound to a expression tree splice that has nested expression
          trees with free variables, this records the types of those variables along with
          the position they occurred in. *)
