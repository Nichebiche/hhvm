error: Typing[4110] Invalid return type

File instance_prop.php, line 9, character 10 - line 9, character 11:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(C $c): int {
 8 |   $x = $c->foo;
 9 |   return »$x«;
10 | }

Expected int

File instance_prop.php, line 7, character 21 - line 7, character 23:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(C $c): »int« {
 8 |   $x = $c->foo;
 9 |   return $x;
10 | }

But got bool

File instance_prop.php, line 4, character 10 - line 4, character 13:

 3 | class C {
 4 |   public »bool« $foo = true;
 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(C $c): int {

Here's why:


  Step 1 of 1                                 (here is where the error occurred) 

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this hint

File instance_prop.php, line 4, character 10 - line 4, character 13:

 3 | class C {
 4 |   public »bool« $foo = true;
 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(C $c): int {

and flows into this expression

File instance_prop.php, line 8, character 8 - line 8, character 14:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(C $c): int {
 8 |   $x = »$c->foo«;
 9 |   return $x;
10 | }

as the type of the property

which itself flows into this expression

File instance_prop.php, line 8, character 3 - line 8, character 4:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(C $c): int {
 8 |   »$x« = $c->foo;
 9 |   return $x;
10 | }

via an assignment

which itself flows into this expression

File instance_prop.php, line 9, character 10 - line 9, character 11:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(C $c): int {
 8 |   $x = $c->foo;
 9 |   return »$x«;
10 | }

as the type of the local variable

which itself flows into this expression

File instance_prop.php, line 9, character 3 - line 9, character 12:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(C $c): int {
 8 |   $x = $c->foo;
 9 |   »return $x;«
10 | }

because it is used in a return position

The supertype comes from this hint

File instance_prop.php, line 7, character 21 - line 7, character 23:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(C $c): »int« {
 8 |   $x = $c->foo;
 9 |   return $x;
10 | }
