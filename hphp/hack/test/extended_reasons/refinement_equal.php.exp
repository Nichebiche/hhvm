error: Typing[4110] Invalid return type

File refinement_equal.php, line 12, character 10 - line 12, character 11:

 10 |     $z = $c;
 11 |   }
 12 |   return »$z«;
 13 | }

Expected ~C

File refinement_equal.php, line 6, character 36 - line 6, character 36:

 4 | class C extends A {}
 5 | 
 6 | function inter_equal(?A $a, C $c): »C« {
 7 |   if($a == null) {
 8 |     $z = $a;
 9 |   } else {
10 |     $z = $c;
11 |   }

But got ?C

File refinement_equal.php, line 6, character 22 - line 6, character 23:

 4 | class C extends A {}
 5 | 
 6 | function inter_equal(»?A« $a, C $c): C {
 7 |   if($a == null) {
 8 |     $z = $a;
 9 |   } else {
10 |     $z = $c;
11 |   }

Here's why:


  Step 1 of 1                                 (here is where the error occurred) 

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this hint

File refinement_equal.php, line 6, character 22 - line 6, character 23:

 4 | class C extends A {}
 5 | 
 6 | function inter_equal(»?A« $a, C $c): C {
 7 |   if($a == null) {
 8 |     $z = $a;
 9 |   } else {
10 |     $z = $c;
11 |   }

and flows into this expression

File refinement_equal.php, line 6, character 25 - line 6, character 26:

 4 | class C extends A {}
 5 | 
 6 | function inter_equal(?A »$a«, C $c): C {
 7 |   if($a == null) {
 8 |     $z = $a;
 9 |   } else {
10 |     $z = $c;
11 |   }

as the parameter hint

which itself flows into this expression

File refinement_equal.php, line 7, character 6 - line 7, character 7:

 4 | class C extends A {}
 5 | 
 6 | function inter_equal(?A $a, C $c): C {
 7 |   if(»$a« == null) {
 8 |     $z = $a;
 9 |   } else {
10 |     $z = $c;
11 |   }

as the type of the local variable

which itself flows into this expression

File refinement_equal.php, line 8, character 10 - line 8, character 11:

 4 | class C extends A {}
 5 | 
 6 | function inter_equal(?A $a, C $c): C {
 7 |   if($a == null) {
 8 |     $z = »$a«;
 9 |   } else {
10 |     $z = $c;
11 |   }

as the type of the local variable

which itself flows into this expression

File refinement_equal.php, line 8, character 5 - line 8, character 6:

 4 | class C extends A {}
 5 | 
 6 | function inter_equal(?A $a, C $c): C {
 7 |   if($a == null) {
 8 |     »$z« = $a;
 9 |   } else {
10 |     $z = $c;
11 |   }

via an assignment

which itself flows into this expression

File refinement_equal.php, line 12, character 10 - line 12, character 11:

 10 |     $z = $c;
 11 |   }
 12 |   return »$z«;
 13 | }

as the type of the local variable

which itself flows into this expression

File refinement_equal.php, line 12, character 3 - line 12, character 12:

 10 |     $z = $c;
 11 |   }
 12 |   »return $z;«
 13 | }

because it is used in a return position

The supertype comes from this declaration

File refinement_equal.php, line 6, character 36 - line 6, character 36:

 4 | class C extends A {}
 5 | 
 6 | function inter_equal(?A $a, C $c): »C« {
 7 |   if($a == null) {
 8 |     $z = $a;
 9 |   } else {
10 |     $z = $c;
11 |   }
