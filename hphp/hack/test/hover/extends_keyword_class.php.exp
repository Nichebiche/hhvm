extends
---
Extending a class allows your class to inherit methods from another class.

Inheritance allows your class to:
 * Reuse methods from the parent class
 * Call `protected` methods on the parent class
 * Be passed as a parameter whenever an instance of the parent class is expected

Hack does not support multiple inheritance on classes. If you need to share functionality between unrelated classes, use traits.
