dynamic
---
Any value at all. Unlike `mixed`, the type checker allows any operation on a `dynamic` value, even if e.g. a method doesn't actually exist.

All operations on a `dynamic` value return another `dynamic` value. Prefer more specific types so the type checker can help you.

To convert a `generic` value to something specific, use `$foo as SomeSpecificType`. This will check the type at runtime and the type checker will verify types after this point.
