final class ImmMap
---
**Prefer `dict` over `ImmMap`**.

`ImmMap` is an immutable `Map`. HHVM provides a native implementation for
this class. The PHP class definition below is not actually used at run time;
it is simply provided for the typechecker and for developer reference.

A `ImmMap` cannot be mutated. No elements can be added or removed from it,
nor can elements be overwritten using assignment (i.e. `$c[$k] = $v` is
not allowed).

Construct it with a `Traversable`:

```
$a = dict['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$fm = new ImmMap($a);
```

or use the literal syntax

```
$fm = ImmMap {'a' => 1, 'b' => 2};
```
