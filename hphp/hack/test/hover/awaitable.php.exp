Awaitable
---
An `Awaitable` value represents a value that is fetched
asynchronously, such as a database access. `Awaitable` values are
usually returned by `async` functions.

Use `await` to wait for a single `Awaitable` value. If you have
multiple `Awaitable`s and you want to wait for all of them
together, use `concurrent` or helper functions like
`Vec\map_async`.

`Awaitable` is not multithreading. Hack is single threaded, so
`Awaitable` allows you to wait for multiple external results at
once, rather than sequentially.
